My name is Zhang Jingcheng, and I am thrilled to be here as a master's graduate in Chemical Engineering seeking PhD program in interdiscipline (not limited to chemistry). I come from a diverse academic and professional background, which has cultivated my passion for solving complex problems through technology.

I completed my postgraduate studies in chemical engineering  at Sun Yat-sen University, where I gained a solid foundation in electrochemistry. During my postgraduate years, I actively participated in vairous projects, which sharpened my experimental skills and taught me the value of teamwork.
